# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-30)

**Core value:** Ein Vertriebler soll im echten Kundengespräch nie wieder ohne Antwort auf einen Einwand dastehen.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — infrastructure-deployment (Wave 2 pending)

## Current Position

Phase: 03.1 (frontend-redesign) — PLANNING
Plan: 0 of TBD (not yet planned)
Status: Phase 3 complete. Phase 3.1 inserted. Ready to plan.
Last activity: 2026-04-01

**Next:** `/gsd:plan-phase 03.1` — design system integration + app page redesign

Progress: [████████░░] ~55% (Phase 2 ✓, Phase 3 ✓, Phase 3.1 pending)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: LEGAL-04 placed in Phase 3 (infrastructure config, not legal document)
- Roadmap: Phase 1 (BIZ) and Phase 2 (PROD) run in parallel — both are independent tracks
- Roadmap: LEGAL-01 through LEGAL-03 grouped with PAY in Phase 4 (both are hard launch blockers, activated together)
- [Phase 02-product-fixes]: DSGVO banner triggered on socket connect event (not transcript) — earliest JS hook before server-side PyAudio capture
- [Phase 02-product-fixes]: SalesNerve Alpha retained in migration SQL WHERE clause — it is the search predicate for legacy record rename, not a branding artifact
- [Phase 02-product-fixes]: database/db.py had its own hardcoded salesnerve.db default — fixed alongside config.py as Rule 1 bug (inconsistent defaults)
- [Phase 02-product-fixes]: No code changes needed — training modes, scoring, preview, and scenario selector verified correct as-is (PROD-03 through PROD-06)
- [Phase 02-product-fixes]: PLANS dict has exactly 3 flat-rate plans: starter/pro/business at 49/59/69 EUR — all legacy keys removed
- [Phase 02-product-fixes]: Org-level fair-use counters (live_minutes_used, training_sessions_used) added alongside user-level counters; soft-warn at 80%, never hard-block
- [Phase 02-product-fixes]: POST wizard_create replaced JSON-API handler with form-data handler — matches HTML form submission pattern in rest of codebase
- [Phase 02-product-fixes]: Wizard redirect placed before expensive stats queries in dashboard route to minimize overhead for new users
- [Phase 03]: gthread 1+4 worker config: matches D-03 for CX22 with Flask-SocketIO threading mode
- [Phase 03]: WebSocket proxy timeouts set to 3600s in nginx — Socket.IO connections are long-lived during full sales calls
- [Phase 03-infrastructure-deployment]: SECRET_KEY check uses os.environ.get('FLASK_DEBUG') not app.debug — app.debug is always False at module-load under gunicorn
- [Phase 03-infrastructure-deployment]: WAL mode listener guarded by sqlite detection — safe for future PostgreSQL upgrade path
- [Phase 03-infrastructure-deployment]: CORS_ORIGIN defaults to nerve.app in production, wildcard only when FLASK_DEBUG env var is set

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 03.1 inserted after Phase 03: Frontend Redesign (INSERTED) — app-page redesign before payments
- Phase 1 (Business Setup) removed from GSD tracking — user handles manually (Gewerbeanmeldung, Geschäftskonto, etc.)

### Pending Todos

- [ ] **Phase 3.1**: Plan and execute Frontend Redesign (Dashboard, Live, Training, Profile, Wizard, Analysis, Sessions)
- [ ] **Phase 1 (manual)**: Gewerbeanmeldung, Geschäftskonto, USt-IdNr, Steuerberater — user handles independently, not tracked here
- [ ] After Phase 3.1: plan Phase 4 (Payments & Legal)

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 4 dependency**: Phase 4 (Stripe) needs verified Stripe account → requires Gewerbeanmeldung + Geschäftskonto (Phase 1 manual, ~3-5 weeks) — user is handling this in parallel
- Research flags: AVV signing portal locations for Deepgram/Anthropic/ElevenLabs should be verified directly. Stripe Tax / VAT invoice configuration for Germany needs explicit research during Phase 4 planning.

## What's Done

| Phase | Plans | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Phase 2: Product Fixes | 6/6 ✓ | Complete — all PROD requirements done |
| Phase 3: Infrastructure & Deployment | 3/3 ✓ | Complete — VPS live on getnerve.app (178.104.82.166), HTTPS, WAL, CORS locked |
| Phase 1: Business Setup | — | Skipped from GSD — user handles manually |

**Phase 3 verification (manual):**
- App accessible at getnerve.app over HTTPS ✓
- VPS: Hetzner CX22, IP 178.104.82.166 ✓
- Remaining checks (Socket.IO 101, WAL mode, CORS lock): user to confirm on VPS
